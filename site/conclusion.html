	<h2 align="center">CONCLUSIONS</h2>
	<p>A system-level hierarchical FDD tool was developed and a simulation study to test and evaluate the tool was conducted. In general, the results were positive: the tool’s primary diagnosis
was correct for 57 of 60 simulation runs (95%). The hierarchical FDD tool was shown to effectively filter equipment-level fault reports and detect and diagnose system-level faults. The tool
shows promise as an overall framework to process fault reports and raw data and present a single integrated system-wide fault status report to the operator.
The results from the simulation study, while promising, suggest some refinements to the hierarchical FDD tool, particularly the ability to infer a higher-level fault from multiple lower-level
fault reports that occur close to the same time but are not simultaneous. Also, the tool should be
evaluated and improved, using faults that are less severe than those considered in this study but
that still impact multiple pieces of equipment. Robust threshold values should be determined
using data from several field sites, to enable the detection of less severe faults without generating or passing on incorrect fault reports. Another enhancement might be the ability to handle
multiple, unrelated faults that may cause the hierarchical FDD tool to suppress real fault reports
from lower levels in the hierarchy while correctly reporting higher level faults.</p>
