<p align="center"><i>A rule-based, system-level fault detection and diagnostic (FDD) method for HVAC systems was
developed. It functions as an interface between multiple, equipment-specific FDD tools and a
human operator. The method resolves and prioritizes conflicting fault reports from equipment-specific FDD tools, performs FDD at the system level, and presents an integrated view of
an HVAC system’s fault status to an operator. A simulation study to test and evaluate the
method was conducted.</p></i>
