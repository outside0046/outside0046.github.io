	<h2 align="center">INTRODUCTION</h2>
	<p>Building HVAC equipment routinely fails to satisfy performance expectations envisioned at
design. Such failures often go unnoticed for extended periods of time. Additionally, higher
expectations are being placed on a combination of different and often conflicting performance
measures, such as energy efficiency, indoor air quality, comfort, reliability, limiting peak
demand on utilities, etc. To meet these expectations, the processes, systems, and equipment used
in both commercial and residential buildings are becoming increasingly sophisticated, which
inadvertently causes more problems. This development both necessitates the use of automated
diagnostics to ensure fault-free operation and enables diagnostic capabilities for the various
building systems by providing a distributed platform that is powerful and flexible enough to perform fault detection and diagnostics (FDD).</p>
<p>Hyvärinen and Kärki (1996) and Dexter and Pakanen (2001) document a number of FDD
tools that are emerging from research. Most of these tools are equipment-specific, meaning they
are meant to detect faults in a chiller, air-handling unit (AHU), etc. A number of studies to
field-test equipment-specific FDD tools shows the need for another tool to act as an interface
between equipment-specific FDD tools and the building operator in order to resolve conflicting
fault reports from the various equipment-specific FDD tools and to present an integrated view of
the HVAC system’s fault status to the operator. House et al. (2001) document an AHU fault that
was actually caused by the unavailability of the chilled water plant. Schein and House (2003)
describe several cases of terminal unit faults caused by problems with the supply air temperature
and pressure provided by the associated AHU, as well as numerous terminal unit and AHU
faults, which were traced to scheduling inconsistencies between terminal units, AHUs, and the
chilled water plant.</p>
<p>The common thread in the previous examples is the set of hierarchical relationships between
the different pieces of equipment composing the HVAC system. Each AHU delivers supply air
to the terminal units it serves, the chilled water plant supplies chilled water to the AHUs, and the
boiler plant provides hot water to the AHUs and some terminal units. These relationships are
each characterized by a single “source” supplying multiple “loads.” In each case, there is an air or water fluid interface between the source and the loads. The temperature and pressure of the
fluid are maintained at setpoint values by the source equipment in order to enable the load
equipment to operate as intended. Normally, each AHU and the terminal units it serves form a
separate, distinct hierarchy. However, the output of each of the chillers is aggregated to form a
single chilled water plant, which then supplies chilled water to all the loads in the system. Similarly, the output of the boilers is aggregated to form a single boiler plant supplying all the hot
water loads in the system.</p>
<p>In order to present an integrated view of an HVAC system’s fault status to the operator, the system-level FDD method developed in this project uses these hierarchical relationships to act as a filter, resolving conflicting fault reports from equipment-specific FDD tools. Knowledge of these
relationships, combined with access to some selected raw data, also allows the method to perform
FDD at the system level. The method is intended to function as an overall framework to process
fault reports and raw data, providing a single system-wide fault status report to the operator.</p>
